## Problem

People want to communicate with each other since they are not able to see each other in person due to work or other reasons. Other people simply want to make new friends.The best way to communicate and make friends is through a chat application that allows them to interact with many people or just one person directly.

### Our Goal
To build a free, easy and private chat room application that allows people to communicate with one another or a group of people. Be allow to have multiple chat rooms running in the same server.

## Abstract

This is a school project for CS401 - Software Engineering. This project will be a simple chat room / messaging system using a client-server model. The project will allow users on the client side to create an account,using a username and password, join a chat room, and send messages in that chat room. The server will maintain each chat room and forward messages from clients in a chat room to all other clients in the same chat room. The server will use a database to maintain user accounts, chat rooms, and chat room message histories. The client application will present controls to create an account, log in, select a chat room to chat with other people, view the chat room's message history once you have entered that specific chat room, and send messages. Also, be able to send private messages between two users. This chat will make a smoother communication for people. Broadcast general notifications, such as user logins and logouts.
